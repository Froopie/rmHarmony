title: Asset Pipeline

About:

rmKit has a basic asset pipeline that will package assets
for the app into the binary itself.

Usage:

To use the asset pipeline, set `ASSET_DIR=asset_dir/` in the app's Makefile,
like so:

--- Code ---
EXE=demo.exe
FILES=main.cpy
ASSET_DIR=assets/

include ../actions.make
------------

Then run *wake assets* to generate an assets.h file. Each file that was in
${ASSET_DIR} will now be available in the assets:: namespace, along with its
size.
