NEXT:

* draw_rect can take a stroke width
* fix grid size button borders to always be there
x fix game over dialog buttons to get their full size
x the minesweeper title should be bigger

TODO:

x it should ask for the grid size first (scene 1)
x then generate the grid (scene 2) Idk if standard randomisation would work
x the cells have 3 states each? You should be able to go through the states by tapping a cell multiple times
* what other buttons do we need? (new game, config, etc)

OPEN QUESTIONS: 
* how to build a UI without left/right click that allows two actions: open cell and flag cell
* can we make a drag and drop interface for putting the flag on cells?

SCENES:

* scene1: game config
* scene2: field + controls for modifying field
* scene3: game over (win or lose)
* scene4: ??
